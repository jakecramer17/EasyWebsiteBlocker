# EasyWebsiteBlocker
A simple and free way to block undesired websites.

**DELETE THIS README AFTER READING**

Setup difficulty: easy
This program is a more scalable version of GeeksforGeeks' Python website blocker. My version is configured to work only on Windows. You can set Windows to run the website blocker on startup using Windows' Task Scheduler. You can find instructions to schedule the script on GeeksforGeeks' tutorial under [Scheduling for Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/website-blocker-using-python/#:~:text=Scheduling%20in%20Windows).

Disable difficulty: medium
I encourage you to read GeeksforGeeks' tutorial for their Python website blocker to understand how this program actually blocks websites. This type of blocker may not prevent expert users from bypassing it, but it should successfully restrict most general users, with even some understanding of Windows. Disabling the blocker will require completing two steps together and in a specific order. For the program's effectiveness, I won't mention them here, but they can be understood after reading GeeksfoGeeks' tutorial.

Usage:
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your PC
2. Clone this repo and hide the folder somewhere on your computer's file system
3. Any new websites can be appended to the "sites" file
4. Schedule the script to be run on startup

That's it! Enjoy.
